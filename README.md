Description:
For those times when your inventories are getting full of the common blocks that you just can't seem to part with long enough, or dump into the void, a trashcan, or an active volcano, now you can compress and keep them!

The blocks become hard to harvest and require a stronger tool as you go up the tiers and they also becomes more blast resistant. I've left a lot of room for expansion in case some of you sickos want to craft blocks of a compression level far exceeding the 8th tier.

Check out the compressed coal blocks, taking them beyond the 4th tier will give you a stack of diamonds, and each tier is 10x the fuel level of the previous tier. Tier 0 is the coal block and it has a burn time of 800.

Caveat: You should notice a recurring pattern on all of the blocks, I've used a simple 4 bit binary system to do the art. Meaning you can encode messages on your walls with these blocks, or just look at them. However, if necessary, the current system can be expanded to 16 levels of compression. I would like to find a procedural way to do that personally as that would allow me to compress anything regardless if I have access to its texture or not.

You can find the cutting edge description and images of what I am doing on my Imgur Album for Kreezxil's Compressed Blocks before I actually get around to updating the texts and images here. However, the files are current here at Curseforge.-------------------------------------------
